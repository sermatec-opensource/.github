# Sermatec Open-source
Welcome to the Sermatec community organization. Here you can find open-source projects related to Sermatec solar inverters. The main goal of these projects is to create self-hosted integrations with other open-source projects to avoid the need of using the official cloud monitoring tools, which are unstable and can be potentionally misused and exploited (see [docs](https://github.com/sermatec-opensource/docs) for more information).
